## My process

### Built with

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript]
- [VueUse](https.//vueuse.org) - Vue utilities library
- [async-validator](https://github.com/yiminghe/async-validator) - With VueUse wrapper



### What I learned

I started this challenge to learn some Typescript, I still have a long way to go but it's a starting point.

I used VueUse for the first time, the particular [`useAsyncValidator`](https://vueuse.org/integrations/useAsyncValidator/#useasyncvalidator) function didn't include much information on how to use it but I found my way reading the source code
